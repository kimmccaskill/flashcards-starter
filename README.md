# Flash Cards

## Abstract

In this project, I wrote out a program to simulate a set of flash cards through the command line! ðŸ˜± A user will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.

The project is broken up into small classes to demonstrate objects that have a single responsibility.

Test driven development has been used to drive code.

## Fork This Repo

On the top right corner of this page, click the **Fork** button.

## Setup

Clone down the forked repo (from your GitHub). Since you don't want to name your project "flashcards-starter", you can use an optional argument when you run `git clone` (you replace the `[...]` with the terminal command arguments):

```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm test` in your terminal. All tests are set up to pass.

## How to Start Game

In the terminal, run:

```bash
node index.js
```

When the game is functioning appropriately, you will be prompted for each question, have the opportunity to select an answer, and will be given feedback. You will be able to play through the entire deck of cards:
